## Use it

**On the web**: open **[justthefile.com](https://justthefile.com)**, paste a link
to an X or Reddit post, pick a quality. No 50 MB ceiling, and you get the
original.

**On Telegram**: **[@xwitter_downloader_bot](https://t.me/xwitter_downloader_bot)**
for X, **[@rddt_downloader_bot](https://t.me/rddt_downloader_bot)** for Reddit.
Hit **Start**, paste a link, get the video back as an mp4.

Either way: nothing to install, no account to make.

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎬 | **Real mp4 files**, playable inline and saveable, not a link to a mirror site |
| 🖼️ | **Multi-video posts**, GIFs as looping animations, photos at original resolution |
| 🔗 | **Short links** resolved automatically: `t.co`, `redd.it`, and Reddit's `/s/` share links |
| 🔊 | **Reddit video arrives with sound**, which most tools drop |
| 📏 | **Smart size-fitting**: picks the best quality that fits Telegram's upload cap |
| ⚡ | **Instant repeats**: previously sent videos return from cache with zero re-download |
| 🎞️ | **Oversized videos still arrive**: compressed to fit, or as a direct link if compressing would ruin them |
| 🕵️ | **Nothing to sign up for**: no account, no login, no cookies. The cache records posts, never who asked for them |

---

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Links accepted |
|---|---|
| **X (Twitter)** | `x.com`, `twitter.com`, `t.co` |
| **Reddit** | `reddit.com`, `redd.it`, `/s/` share links |

---

## Run your own

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # bot tokens from @BotFather
docker compose up -d    # both bots + the web front end
```

Everything else is a comment in `.env.example`. The web front end binds to
`127.0.0.1:8080`, so put a TLS terminator in front of it.

Reddit blocks a lot of hosting providers by IP address. If yours is one,
[relay/README.md](relay/README.md) is the way round it.

## Notes

This relies on undocumented endpoints that can change without warning, which is
why every platform here resolves through two independent providers rather than
one.
