"""JSON API + static front end.

One endpoint does the work: paste a link, get back every downloadable rendition
with a direct CDN URL. The browser fetches the bytes itself, so this process
never touches media, which is what keeps it cheap enough to run beside the bot
on the same small VPS.

Nothing here names a platform. Which links are accepted, and how they resolve,
is entirely `core.platforms`.
