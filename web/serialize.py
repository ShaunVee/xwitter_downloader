"""Resolution -> the JSON shape the front end consumes.

The bot picks one variant on the user's behalf, because Telegram only accepts
one and it has to fit under 50 MB. A browser has neither constraint, so this
hands over the whole ladder and lets the user choose, which means every
rendition needs a readable label and a size to choose between.

Nothing here is platform-specific except `_RESOLUTION_RE`, which is a best
effort at reading a size out of a URL and simply finds nothing when a future
platform doesn't put one there.
