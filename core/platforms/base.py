"""The contract every platform implements.

Lives in its own module so a handler can import `Resolution` without importing
the registry that imports the handler.

A platform is a plain module exposing:

    NAME     stable slug, used in cache keys and the API payload
    LABEL    what a human is told is supported
    HOSTS    domains for the "works with…" hint on the page
    DELIVERY how the bytes can reach the user (see below)
    identify(url, client)   -> post id, or None if this isn't ours
    fetch(post_id, client)  -> Resolution

`identify` is async because recognising a link can need the network: a t.co
shortlink says nothing about its destination until it is followed.

Returning None from `identify` means "not my platform" and lets the registry
try the next one. A `Resolution` with no items means "mine, but there's nothing
in it": a different answer, and a different HTTP status.

Raising `LinkUnresolved` from `identify` is the third answer: "mine, but the
network hop that resolves it failed". Folding that into None told people their
link was unrecognisable when the link was fine and the site was not.

#   DIRECT     The CDN sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so the browser fetches
#              it and the server never sees the bytes. X only. Costs nothing.
#   PROXY      No CORS header, so a browser cannot read the response at all and
#              the server has to stream it through. TikTok.
