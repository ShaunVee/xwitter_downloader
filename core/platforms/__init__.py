"""Platform registry.

Adding a platform is a new module in this package plus one entry in REGISTRY.
Nothing above this line (the API, the cache, the front end) needs to change,
because none of it names a platform.

Order matters only where two platforms could claim the same URL. Today nothing
overlaps, so the order is just the order they were added.
