"""Reddit.

Delivery is the interesting part. Reddit uses two CDNs and they do not
behave the same way, which only showed up by measuring both:

    v.redd.it   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *   browser may fetch it
    i.redd.it   no CORS header                   browser may not

So a silent video can go direct, a video with sound needs muxing because DASH
keeps audio in its own file, and an image needs proxying despite being the
simplest case of the three. Delivery is therefore decided per item, not per
platform.
