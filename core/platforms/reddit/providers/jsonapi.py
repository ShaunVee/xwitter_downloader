"""Fallback provider: Reddit's own post JSON.

Cleaner data than scraping, and unusable on its own: it returns 403 in bursts
from a single IP with no warning and no Retry-After, then recovers. That makes
it a good second opinion and a bad primary.

It earns its place on the cases the HTML is thin on, chiefly crossposts, where
the media belongs to the parent post and the child page only references it.

If this ever needs to become the primary source, the supported route is an
OAuth client-credentials token against oauth.reddit.com, which lifts the limit
to roughly 100 requests/minute. That needs a client id and secret in the
environment, so it is a deployment decision rather than a code one.
